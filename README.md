# ai-language-tutor-tests

This project is dedicated to mastering the `pytest` framework as part of the **Python Testing Path** from Test Automation University. It is structured as a practical learning repository to reinforce key testing concepts and apply them to a real-world application: the AI Language Tutor.

The goal is to demonstrate strong proficiency in automated testing using `pytest` through examples that include unit testing, fixtures, test filtering, configuration, and integrations with API and UI workflows.

---

## Pytest Commands & Configuration

_This section will cover commonly used CLI commands (`-v`, `-k`, `-s`, etc.) and how to use a `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` file to configure pytest behavior._

---

## Filtering Tests

_This section will demonstrate test filtering using markers, names, and expressions to selectively run tests._

---

## Plugins

_This section will introduce useful plugins like `pytest-cov` for test coverage and how to install and use them._

---

## API Testing

_This section will show how to test RESTful APIs using `requests` + `pytest`, including response validation and error handling._

---

## UI Testing

_This section will demonstrate basic Selenium-based UI testing within a `pytest` test suite, covering DOM assertions and form validations._
