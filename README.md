# Pytest Foundational Knowledge
The goal of this project is to demonstrate strong proficiency in automated testing using `pytest` through hands-on examples. These include unit testing, fixtures, test filtering, configuration, and integration with API and UI workflows.

All tests will be written for the **AI-Language-Tutor** application, which includes both frontend and backend components.

- üîó **Frontend Repository:** [ai-language-tutor-frontend](https://github.com/bryan-melo/ai-language-tutor-frontend)  
- üîó **Backend Repository:** [ai-language-tutor-backend](https://github.com/bryan-melo/ai-language-tutor-backend)  
- üåê **Hosted App:** [Live Fullstack App](https://ai-language-tutor-frontend-sable.vercel.app/)
